Dancer2 based application to import and read nginx error logs.

Reading and filtering through error logs is always a pain hence this program.

##Features
- Multiple domains
- Import log files 
- Filter out items addressed by marking them as fixed
- Filter by images or others (i.e. not images), or sort by status of the error

Suggestions are more than welcome.
